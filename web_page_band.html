    <h2>Here is some examples:</h2>
<div class="my_class">
  <p class="column">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
    random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
    literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
    a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
    Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
    the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
    undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
    1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good
    and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on
    the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first
    line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
    in section 1.10.32.</p>

    <p class="column">There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but
      the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,
       or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a
      passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
      embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p>

    <p class="column">All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to
      repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the
      first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200
      Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures,
      to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.</p>

    <p class="column">It is a long established fact that a reader will be
      distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.</p>

    <p class="column">Various versions have evolved over the years,
      sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
