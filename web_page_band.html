      <h2>History:</h2>
    <p class="column">Snow Patrol are a rock band from Northern Ireland,
      formed in Dundee, Scotland in 1994, consisting of Gary Lightbody (vocals, guitar),
      Nathan Connolly (guitar, backing vocals),
      Paul Wilson (bass guitar, backing vocals),
      Jonny Quinn (drums),
      and Johnny McDaid (piano, guitar, backing vocals).
      Initially an indie rock band, the band rose to prominence in the early-mid 2000s as
      part of the post-Britpop movement.</p>

    <p class="column">Scottish-Irish alt-rock outfit Snow Patrol broke
      into the mainstream with their 2003 major-label debut, Final Straw,
      a collection of earnest tunes aligned with the sounds of contemporaries
      like Coldplay, Keane, and Travis. They followed with the success of 2006's
      Eyes Open -- which featured the international hit single "Chasing Cars" -- paving
      the way for the band's U.K. Top Ten platinum efforts A Hundred Million
      Suns and Fallen Empires. After an extended six-year hiatus,
      during which time frontman Gary Lightbody worked as a songwriter
      for pop artists, the band returned with Wildness in 2018.</p>

    <p class="column">As Snow Patrol's audience modestly expanded,
      the trio relocated to Glasgow upon graduation. Their second
      full-length album, When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear
      Up, was released in April 2001. Jeepster dropped the band from
      its roster that same year, however, prompting Lightbody to blow
      off steam by forming the Reindeer Section, a Scottish supergroup
      featuring members of Mogwai and Belle and Sebastian. He also
      continued writing songs for Snow Patrol, including a promising
      ballad entitled "Run." After guitarist Nathan Connolly joined the
      group in 2002, Snow Patrol signed a contract with Fiction Records
      and began recording a new album alongside producer Chris Lord-Alge.
      With the power ballad "Run" serving as its lead single, Final Straw became
      the band's breakthrough hit album, spinning off four Top 40 singles in the U.K.
      (including "Spitting Games") and eventually selling more than four million copies worldwide.

    <p class="column">Led by the single "Take Back the City,"
      A Hundred Million Suns featured an emphasis on positive,
      romantic lyrics, something that Gary Lightbody had pointedly
      shunned in the past. The band joined U2 on the road once again,
      this time playing stadiums in Europe and America during the summer
      of 2009. Rather than record another album after the tour, however,
      they chose to release the comprehensive Up to Now, a compilation
      spanning Snow Patrol's 15-year history. Lightbody and Simpson also
      teamed up to compile a mix album, LateNightTales, which featured the
      band's own take on INXS' "New Sensation." Lightbody admitted to a
      frustrating bout of writer's block before embarking on the group's
      sixth studio album, 2011's Fallen Empires, which featured the single
      "Called Out in the Dark."</p>

    <p class="column">After the release of 2013's Greatest Hits set,
      Snow Patrol fell silent. After Simpson parted ways with the group,
      they returned to the studio, teasing new music over the years without
      any official releases. Members went on to start families and embark on
      new side projects, as well as producing and songwriting for other artists
      like Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Robbie Williams, Ed Sheeran, P!nk, Kodaline,
      and Taylor Swift. New material from Snow Patrol would not arrive until 2018.
      Their fifth straight effort with producer Jacknife Lee, Wildness came into being
      following Lightbody's newfound sobriety, and addressed themes of primal nature in
      the modern age on singles like "Empress" and "Life on Earth."
